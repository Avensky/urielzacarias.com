                    I am a full stack web developer looking for an entry level position. 
                    I began developing full stack web applications in May 2019. My experience comes from
                    working on websites and blog passion projects. The first website I worked on was a prebuilt forum used by an 
                    online group of friends. This sparked my interest in building my own website. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>    
                    I began learning to write code
                    by reading a book called "Learn Python the Hard way" by Zed A. Shaw. I then built my first website using php by following
                    online tutorials. It was in July of 2018 when I decided to build web applications 
                    for a living and began to learn by immersion and practicing daily. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>    
                    I refreshed my frontend skills by completing the Responsive Web Design  
                    certificate from FreeCodeCamp in March 2019. I moved on to complete the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity in September 
                    2019. This certificate focused on building web applications using an Ubuntu server and Flask frontend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I felt something was missing, my website ran too slow, so I began searching for something better. I decided to complete 
                    React-The Complete Guide (Incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) at Udemy in April 2020. And now I am developing web applications 
                    by reading documentations and research.
